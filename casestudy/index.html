            <h2>The Overview</h2>
            <p>PHP is the most popular scripting language for web development. It is free, open source and server-side. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). It is also free and open source. The combination of PHP and MySQL gives unmet options to create just about any kind of website. In this course, students will be challenged to experiment with database manipulation, server-side technologies, and interaction between the two. This project serves to strengthen students’ ability to work with more powerful scripting languages and influence the outcomes from database content. Criteria that must be met to successfully complete Scripting for Interactive Digital Media II includes code quality, functionality, design, and technique.</p>

            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Background / Timeline / Purpose</h3>
            <p>Scripting for Interactive Digital Media II builds upon topics covered in Scripting for Interactive Digital Media I, and introduces students to modern server-side technologies for internet based delivery of dynamic content that connect to and manipulate database content. The purpose of this course was for students to create a project from scratch that allows users to interact with relational database content through browser web pages. By the end of the course, students were able to define proper usage of server-side technologies, employ server-side technologies to pull data from a database, and construct an interactive, data-driven project. The timeline for students to complete this project was 9 weeks, respecting Drexel’s quarter schedule.</p>
            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>This project exists for students to expand their scripting language knowledge, introducing PHP and MySQL, and to provide a hands-on project that manipulates database content and server-side technologies. This project demonstrates how PHP and MySQL are powerful tools when it comes to pulling and implementing data.</p>
            <h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
            <p>The end goal of this project was for students to create a custom web application from scratch, an online cookbook, featuring a library of recipes which were provided to them. Students were to use PHP and MySQL as the primary programming and data manipulation languages. Each student’s project was to be uniquely branded and had to display each recipe while providing a user interface for browsing, searching, and filtering through all of the available content. The application was required to include PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and GitHub for source code tracking. Data was to be stored and served from a MySQL database, running on a live web server and being fully responsive from ranging from a smartphone to desktop monitor. </p>
            <p>This was a solo project, focused on engaging students with a new concept of database and server-side technology manipulation. Students were required to learn new scripting languages and database functionalities in order to complete this course, which involved focus and determination to progressively develop this project. After nine weeks of introducing new concepts and algorithms, students are better prepared for the scripting world than they were when they entered this course. </p>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>These are wireframes that were brought into concept during the brainstorming process of this project. I wanted to exhibit optimal organization with a minimalistic design for my viewers.</p>

            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>The style guide for this project was a huge part of bringing the web application together. Once the primary code was implemented, styling with CSS brought “The Chew” brand together. Colors included in this design were specifically chosen reflecting inspiration from words like fresh, organic, and homemade.</p>

            <h3>Code & Development</h3>
            <p>PHP and MySQL were the primary programming and data manipulation languages for this course, which gave students the opportunity to pull data from a database and implement it where they wanted to within their design. These languages were essential to creating a successful project for this course, and are extremely powerful for making dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>For my final design, I wanted to create an online cookbook that was accessible and easy to navigate for all users. The search bar is coded to detect any input and pull similar data from the MySQL database in seconds, providing a curious user with the results they want to see. The filters section is split into categories by protein, so that users who have specific dietary needs or restrictions can quickly find a recipe that can satisfy them. Each recipe on the main page includes an image of what the final dish may resemble, cook time, and calories per serving so that visitors to my website can have an enjoyable and efficient experience. Recipe pages include a list of ingredients, as well as step-by-step instructions with images to ensure a manageable process.</p>

            <h2>The Solutions</h2>
            <p>I believe this project was successful. Throughout this course, I learned how to integrate PHP into scripting languages I had pre-existing knowledge on, pull data from a database (we used PHPMyAdmin), and include a working search and filter method. I feel that my end goal, The Chew, answered the problem solving components of this project and demonstrates a well structured online cookbook. The main lesson this project has taught me is that technology, specifically programming languages, are extremely controlling and influential tools. Scripting for Interactive Digital Media II has intensified my appreciation and understanding of code, and has inspired me to keep learning more. </p>
